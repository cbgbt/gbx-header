# gbx-header

This is a personal fork of [gbx-header](https://github.com/mtib/gbx-header) by [mtib](https://github.com/mtib/).
I wanted to use the software to parse Trackmania 2020 replay files, it seems like a few of the fields of changed since TM Forever.
This fork is not well tested for the features of the original repo.
Use at your own risk.
